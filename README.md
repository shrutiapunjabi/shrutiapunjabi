## 🚀 Featured Project: Financial News Sentiment Analysis & S&P 500

**End-to-end FinTech project analyzing how financial news sentiment impacts equity market movements and trading performance.**

### 🔍 Project Overview
- Analyzed **18,000+ financial news headlines (2008–2024)** across multiple market regimes
- Applied **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to extract sentiment from financial news
- Integrated sentiment with **S&P 500 price data**
- Built **machine learning models** to predict market direction
- Designed a **sentiment-driven trading strategy** evaluated using risk-adjusted metrics

### 🧠 Methodology
- Finance-aware text preprocessing (lemmatization, stopwords, noise removal)
- VADER sentiment scoring for short financial text
- Daily sentiment aggregation aligned with trading days
- Feature engineering:
  - Lagged sentiment (1–5 days)
  - Rolling volatility (risk regime detection)
- Models:
  - Balanced Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable)
  - Random Forest (non-linear relationships)
- Time-series train/test split (no data leakage)

### 📈 Key Results
- Directional prediction accuracy: ~51% (realistic for financial markets)
- **Sentiment-based strategy achieved a higher Sharpe ratio than the market**
- Demonstrated that **risk-adjusted performance matters more than raw accuracy**

📌 **Key Insight:**  
> In financial markets, even small predictive edges can be economically valuable when combined with proper risk management.
